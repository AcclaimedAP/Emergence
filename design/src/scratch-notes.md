# Kremling worldbuilding scratch notes

- units: wholesome, not nasty
  - basket crabs!
    - artificial basket on back
    - arthroprod-like
    - smart and slow
    - can get flipped upside-down!
    - young have no shells
    - cannot climb: short hops only
  - water striders
  - rolling beetles
  - web spinner
  - flyers
- islands scattered in the sea
  - geysers of water, pushed up from the sea at the center of each island
  - each geyser can have a different water type
  - slopes downhill from geyser to shore
  - when water hits the sea, melds back into sea water?
  - distinct islands reduce risks of catastrophic failures, even as localized failures occur
  - limited land area encourages smarter growth
  - use striders for inter-island shipping
  - can filter water for dirt items: renewable source enables island expansion and even land bridges
- tide pools!
  - tides probably slower: weekly?
- seasons
  - repeating and predictable
  - all have upside and downside
  - which season you start in is randomized
- scarred but healing Earth, quite a while in the future after humanity's extinction
  - unusable land that must be crossed (thematic + encourages distinct bases and logistics)
- structure / item ideas
  - cliff to smash stuff
  - floating things down rivers
  - highly buoyant plant
  - slides for goods and units downhill
  - fungi to compost still
- avoid human-like vibes
  - absolutely no "human tech but in wood"
  - no fire or heated food
  - no electricity (except maybe shockers)
  - avoid humanoid body plans and postures
- factory builder, not colony sim: complex production, simple unit needs and preferences
- predators!
- plants that grow together, forming bridges
- plants that pump water, by weeping out water gathered from roots
  - roots require specific terrain type?
