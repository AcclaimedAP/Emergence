# Kremling worldbuilding scratch notes

- units
  - kremling
    - artificial basket on back
    - arthroprod-like
    - smart and slow
    - can get flipped upside-down!
    - young have no shells
    - cannot climb: short hops only
  - water striders
  - rolling beetles
  - web spinner
  - flyers
- wholesome, not nasty
- tide pools!
  - tides probably slower: weekly?
- seasons
  - repeating and predictable
  - all have upside and downside
  - which season you start in is randomized
- scarred but healing Earth, quite a while in the future after humanity's extinction
  - unusable land that must be crossed (thematic + encourages distinct bases and logistics)
- structure / item ideas
  - cliff to smash stuff
  - floating things down rivers
  - highly buoyant plant
  - slides for goods and units downhill
  - fungi to compost still
- avoid human-like vibes
  - absolutely no "human tech but in wood"
  - no fire or heated food
  - no electricity (except maybe shockers)
  - avoid humanoid body plans and postures
- factory builder, not colony sim: complex production, simple unit needs and preferences
- predators!
